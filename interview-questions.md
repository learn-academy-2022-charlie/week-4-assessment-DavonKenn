# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer: Props  in react means properties and gives us the ability to pass data down to nested components.
Props are like  arguments to a function. I currently used props in class to pass into a components in my tic tac toe challenge using this.props.

  Researched answer:
Props(properties) give us the ability to communicate by passing data and methods between components. Props also gives us the ability to pass data down to nested components.Data from props is read-only, and cannot be modified by a component that is receiving it from outside.Props cannot be modified.


2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer:
DOM tracks whats need to be clicked,it tracks when your hover over something in the application and it reacts. DOM is basically like a tracker.For example i previously used DOM by creating an onclick button for a pig latin application.
 
  Researched answer:
The DOM (Document Object Model) is always listening for changes. As a user moves their mouse across the screen, the DOM reacts by changing the view to represent the cursor's position.It allows JavaScript to register different event handlers on elements in an HTML document.


3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: Object-oriented programming(OOP) is used with other languages like ruby that focus on data and objects.The difference between OOP and functional programming is functional  programming use mostly variables and functions.

  Researched answer:
  Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.OOP focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them. This approach to programming is well-suited for programs that are large, complex and actively updated or maintained. This includes programs for manufacturing and design, as well as mobile applications.n functional programming, data cannot be stored in objects, and it can only be transformed by creating functions. 



4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer: A float in Ruby is a number with  decimal pointe a interger is a whole number. At first jumping from Ruby to javascript I was confused hearing interger but float is the same thing. If your using any number or dividing substracting or adding anything in ruby your going to be using intergers and floats.

  Researched answer:Float is a number that has a decimal point it is needed when a more precisse number is needed. A interger has no decimal point.They are two different kinds of numerical datas.Something interesting is a interger can be added to a float.

5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: An implicit return means you dont have to put a retun with a method.It automatically does it for you.

  Researched answer:
Ruby has an implicit return, which means the value of the last line of a method is automatically returned without using the keyword return.


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Instance Variable:An instance variable in ruby has a name starting with @ symbol, and its content is restricted to whatever the object itself refers to. Two separate objects, even though they belong to the same class, are allowed to have different values for their instance variables.

2. PostgreSQL:

3. Ruby on Rails:PostgreSQL is used as the primary data store or data warehouse for many web, mobile, geospatial, and analytics applications. 

4. ORM:Object Relational Mapping (ORM) is the technique of accessing a relational database using an object-oriented programming language. Object Relational Mapping is a way for our Ruby programs to manage database data by "mapping" database tables to classes and instances of classes to rows in those tables.

5. Active Record:Active Record is the M in MVC - the model - which is the layer of the system responsible for representing business data and logic. Active Record facilitates the creation and use of business objects whose data requires persistent storage to a database.
